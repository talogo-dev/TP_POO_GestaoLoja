# Practical Project - Object-Oriented Programming: Store Management System

### Project Description

This project was developed in **C#**, following the **N-Tier architecture**.  
It provides an efficient and modular solution for managing **customers, sales, and products** in a store environment.  
The system demonstrates solid principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

---

### Architecture Overview

The project is structured according to the **N-Tier architecture**, ensuring a clear separation of concerns:

- **Presentation Layer (UI):** Handles user interaction and input/output operations.  
- **Business Logic Layer (BLL):** Implements the core logic, rules, and validations of the system.  
- **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Manages database operations such as queries and persistence.  
- **Entities Layer (Models):** Contains the definitions of the main classes and their attributes.
